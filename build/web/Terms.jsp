<p><b>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</b></p>
<p margin="0">This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (Statement) derives from the Socioware Principles, and governs our 
relationship with users and others who interact with Socioware. By using or accessing Socioware, you agree to 
this Statement.</p> 
<p><b>1.Privacy<p></b>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Socioware to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.</p>
<p><b>2.Sharing Your Content and Information</b></p>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Socioware, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition: For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings. We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information. When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people of Socioware, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you </p>
<p><b>3.Safety</b></p>
<p>We do our best to keep Socioware safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:</p>
<p><ul>
	<li>We do our best to keep Socioware safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:</li>
	<li>You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Socioware. </li>
	<li>You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Socioware, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission. You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Socioware. You will not upload viruses or other malicious code. </li>
	<li>You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else. You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user. </li>
	<li>You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence. </li>

	<li>You will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws if you publicize or offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (âpromotionâ) on Socioware. </li>
	<li>You will not use Socioware to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory. You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of Socioware, such as a denial of service attack. </li>

        <p><b>4.Registration and Account Security</b></p>
        <p>Socioware users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account: </p>
<p>You will not provide any false personal information on Socioware, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission. You will not create more than one personal profile. If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission. You will not use your personal profile for your own commercial gain (such as selling your status update to an advertiser). You will not use Socioware if you are under 13. You will not use Socioware if you are a convicted sex offender. You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date. You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account. You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission. If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name). </p>
<p><b>5.Protecting Other People's Rights</b></p>
<p>We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same. </p>
<p>You will not post content or take any action on Socioware that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law. </p>
<p>We can remove any content or information you post on Socioware if we believe that it violates this Statement. </p>
<p>We will provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more, visit our How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement page. </p>
<p>If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal. </p>
<p>If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate. </p>
<p>You will not use our copyrights or trademarks  or any confusingly similar marks, without our written permission. </p>

 <p>obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not Socioware) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it. </p>
 <p>You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on Socioware. You will not tag users or send email invitations to non-users without their consent.

<p> If you are acquired by or merge with a third party, you can continue to use user data within your application, but you cannot transfer user data outside of your application. We can require you to delete user data if you use it in a way that we determine is inconsistent with usersâ expectations. </p>
 <p>We can limit your access to data. You will comply with all other restrictions contained in our Socioware Platform Policies. You will not give us information that you independently collect from a user or a user's content without that user's consent. You will make it easy for users to remove or disconnect from your application. You will make it easy for users to contact you. We can also share your email address with users and others claiming that you have infringed or otherwise violated their rights. </p>

 <p>You give us the right to link to or frame your application, and place content, including ads, around your application. We can analyze your application, content, and data for any purpose, including commercial. </p>
 <p>To ensure your application is safe for users, we can audit it. We can create applications that offer similar features and services to, or otherwise compete with, your application. </p>

<ul>
	<li>You give us permission to use your name and profile picture in connection with that content, subject to the limits you place. We do not give your content or information to advertisers without your consent. </li>
