	<ul><li><h2>Top Questions</h2></li></ul>

<h2>Why didn't my friend request go through? </h2> 

Socioware  is a place for connecting with friends, family, and other people you know personally. 

If you’ve been prevented from adding friends on Socioware, it’s likely because friend requests you’ve sent have gone unanswered or members reported your contact as unwelcome. 

You’ll be allowed to add friends again soon. At that time, please remember to only send friend requests and messages to people who you already know personally. 
<h2>How do I add a friend? </h2>
Search for your friend’s profile (timeline) using the search bar at the top of any Socioware page. Find the person you know and click on the Add as Friend button to the right of their name. 

A friend request will be sent to that person. Once they confirm that they actually are friends with you, they will show up on your list of Socioware friends. 

Please note that privacy settings may limit your ability to see the "Add as Friend" link for some users. 

<h2>Who should I send friend requests to? </h2> 

Socioware is a place for connecting with friends, family, and other people you know personally. You should send friend requests to people you have a family connection, share same friend circle or the communities working for the wellfare of the society/city/state/country. 

<h2>How do I remove or cancel a friend request I made to someone? </h2>
<ul>
	Go to that person's profile (timeline)
	Hover over the Friend Request Sent button at the top of the page
	Click Cancel Request from the dropdown menu.
	Pending Friend Requests
</ul>

<h2>I sent someone a friend request, but they did not receive it. </h2>

Please provide adequate time for the person to take action on the request as they may have missed the notification email or may have not seen it on their Home page yet. If you sent this request using the Friend Finder, please make sure that you sent it to an email address that is listed on this person's account. If the request was sent to a different email address, then it will not appear in their account. 

<h2>What are mutual friends? </h2>

Mutual friends are the people who are Socioware friends with both you and the person whose profile  you are viewing. For instance, if you are friends with Chris, and Mark is friends with Chris, then Chris will be shown as a mutual friend when you are viewing Mark's profile . 

	<h2>Warnings and Disabled Accounts</h2>

<h3>  I am blocked or disabled</h3>
<h2>I am blocked from sending friend requests. </h2>

Socioware is a place for connecting with people you know, like your friends, family, classmates and coworkers. If you’ve been blocked from sending friend requests, it may be because friend requests you’ve sent have gone unanswered or been marked as unwelcome. Note that this block is temporary. 

<h2>My personal Socioware account is disabled. </h2> 

There are different reasons why you may not be able to access your account and unique ways to contact Socioware for each case. Therefore, it is important to be sure that you are using the correct channel when submitting a request for help. First, identify the correct reason why you are unable to access your account from the three reasons that are listed below. Then, follow the instructions listed by the reason that pertains to you. 

<h2>What if I didn't receive a warning before becoming disabled? </h2> 

Depending on the severity of the violation, a warning might not have been issued before disabling your account. Please note that we do not restore accounts

<h2>My friend's Socioware account is blocked or disabled. </h2> 

If your friend is disabled, they will need to submit an appeal directly from their own login email address. Please have your friend view the Disabled section of the Help Center for detailed instructions.
